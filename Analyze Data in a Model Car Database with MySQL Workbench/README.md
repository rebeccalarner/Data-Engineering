# Overview

In this project, you will step into the shoes of an entry-level data analyst at the fictional Mint Classics Company, helping to analyze data in a relational database with the goal of supporting inventory-related business decisions that lead to the closure of a storage facility.

**Project Scenario**

Mint Classics Company, a retailer of classic model cars and other vehicles, is looking at closing one of their storage facilities.

To support a data-based business decision, they are looking for suggestions and recommendations for reorganizing or reducing inventory, while still maintaining timely service to their customers. For example, they would like to be able to ship a product to a customer within 24 hours of the order being placed.

As a data analyst, you have been asked to use MySQL Workbench to familiarize yourself with the general business by examining the current data. You will be provided with a data model and sample data tables to review. You will then need to isolate and identify those parts of the data that could be useful in deciding how to reduce inventory. You will write queries to answer questions like these:

1) Where are items stored and if they were rearranged, could a warehouse be eliminated?

2) How are inventory numbers related to sales figures? Do the inventory counts seem appropriate for each item?

3) Are we storing items that are not moving? Are any items candidates for being dropped from the product line?

The answers to questions like those should help you to formulate suggestions and recommendations for reducing inventory with the goal of closing one of the storage facilities.

**Project Objectives**

1. Explore products currently in inventory.

2. Determine important factors that may influence inventory reorganization/reduction.

3. Provide analytic insights and data-driven recommendations.

**Your Challenge**

Your challenge will be to conduct an exploratory data analysis to investigate if there are any patterns or themes that may influence the reduction or reorganization of inventory in the Mint Classics storage facilities. To do this, you will import the database and then analyze data. You will also pose questions, and seek to answer them meaningfully using SQL queries to retrieve data from the database provided.

In this project, we'll use the fictional Mint Classics relational database and a relational data model. Both will be provided.

After you perform your analysis, you will share your findings.


# See Example Projects

Before you dive into conducting your own exploratory data analysis, you may want to see an example of what you'll be doing.

To make sure learners create unique analyses, we won't show an example of a classic models database. Instead, we've included examples with other types of data. While the data (and platform) is different in each case, you'll find the methodologies and SQL examples useful.

_Hint: Although these examples produce a variety of output, remember that your deliverable/artifact in this project will be a collection of SQL queries to validate your suggestions for inventory reduction._

**Example 1:**

In this [example](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-business-analytics-training/ "Link to an example of data analysis with SQL on mode.com"), SQL is used to investigate a drop in user engagement in a social media network.

**Example 2:**

In this [example](https://dev.to/heyfunmi/exploratory-data-analysis-using-sql-4jin "Link to Exploratory Data Analysis Using SQL"), SQL is used to analyze a dataset of petrol/gas prices of ALL the countries in the world.
