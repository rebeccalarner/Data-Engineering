# ETL Pipeline for Real-time Analytics

Develop an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that captures real-time data from various sources, transforms it, and then loads it into a data warehouse. This project could demonstrate your capabilities in real-time data processing and warehousing.

**Skills Highlighted:**

-   Data Streaming
-   Real-Time Analytics
-   Cloud-based Data Warehousing (e.g., AWS Redshift, Snowflake)

### Overview

1.  **Data Sources**: Identify the various data sources (e.g., APIs, databases, streams).
2.  **Data Ingestion**: Utilize tools like Apache Kafka for real-time data ingestion.
3.  **Data Transformation**: Leverage Spark or similar computing engines for data transformation.
4.  **Data Loading**: Use Snowpipe or batch loading to populate the Snowflake data warehouse.

### Detailed Architecture

#### Step 1: Data Sources

-   APIs (RESTful/SOAP)
-   Relational Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
-   Streaming Data (Sensor data, logs)
-   File Systems (CSV, Parquet)

#### Step 2: Data Ingestion

-   **Apache Kafka**: To capture real-time data streams.
    -   Producer APIs: To send data streams to Kafka topics.
    -   Consumer APIs: To read data streams from Kafka topics.

#### Step 3: Data Transformation

-   **Apache Spark**: To perform ETL operations on the ingested data.
    -   Use Spark Structured Streaming for real-time processing.
    -   Transformations can include cleaning, enriching, and aggregating data.

#### Step 4: Data Loading into Snowflake

-   **Snowpipe**: For real-time data loading.
    -   Auto-ingest feature to load data as soon as new data lands in the cloud storage.

OR

-   **Batch Loading**: For less time-sensitive data.
    -   Use COPY INTO commands for batch data loading.

### Sample Code Snippets

1.  **Kafka Producer** (Python)
```python
from kafka import KafkaProducer producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092') producer.send('my_topic', b'Test message')
```
2. **Spark Structured Streaming** (Scala)
```scala
val spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("StructuredKafkaWordCount").getOrCreate()
val df = spark.readStream.format("kafka").option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092").load()
```
3. **Snowpipe** (SQL)
```sql
CREATE  OR REPLACE PIPE my_snowpipe AUTO_INGEST =  TRUE  AS  COPY  INTO my_table FROM $my_stage;
```

### Monitoring and Maintenance

-   Use Snowflakeâ€™s Query History for auditing and performance tuning.
-   Implement alerting mechanisms for pipeline failures.

### Security Measures

-   Use SSL/TLS for secure data transfer.
-   Implement IAM roles and SSO for access control.
