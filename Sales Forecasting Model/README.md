# Sales Forecasting Model

Create a model that utilizes historical sales data to predict future sales for an organization. This would include data collection, cleaning, model development, and results visualization.

**Skills Highlighted:**

-   Time Series Analysis
-   Machine Learning
-   Data Visualization


## Overview

### Phase 1: Data Collection

1.  **Sources Identification**:

-   Internal Systems (CRM, ERP)
-   External Data (Market trends, Seasonal indices)

2.  **Data Extraction**:

-   SQL queries for database retrieval
-   API calls for web-based data sources

3.  **Data Storage**:

-   Choose a storage solution like a data warehouse

### Phase 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

1.  **Data Audit**:

-   Identify missing values, outliers, and duplicates

2.  **Data Imputation and Transformation**:

-   Use methods like mean imputation for missing values
-   Apply transformations like log, or min-max scaling if needed

3.  **Feature Engineering**:

-   Create new variables that might explain the target variable better

### Phase 3: Model Development

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

-   Visualize the data to understand trends and patterns

2.  **Variable Selection**:

-   Use correlation matrices or feature importance methods

3.  **Model Selection**:

-   Linear Regression for simpler models
-   ARIMA for time-series data
-   Random Forest or Gradient Boosting for more complex relations

4.  **Model Training**:

-   Split the data into training and testing sets
-   Use cross-validation for better generalization

5.  **Model Evaluation**:

-   Use metrics like RMSE, MAE, or MAPE

### Phase 4: Results Visualization and Interpretation

1.  **Dashboard Creation**:

-   Utilize BI tools like Tableau or Power BI for real-time insights

2.  **Report Generation**:

-   Summarize findings, ROI and business impact in a formal report

3.  **Presentation to Stakeholders**:

-   Use clear and concise slides to present the results to decision-makers

### Technologies and Tools to Consider:

-   **Data Collection**: SQL, Python (for API calls)
-   **Data Cleaning**: Python libraries like Pandas
-   **Model Development**: Python libraries such as scikit-learn, statsmodels, or R
-   **Results Visualization**: Tableau, Power BI

### Timeline

-   **Phase 1**: 2 weeks
-   **Phase 2**: 3 weeks
-   **Phase 3**: 4-6 weeks
-   **Phase 4**: 2 weeks

By meticulously adhering to this structured approach, an organization can effectively predict future sales, thereby enabling data-driven decision-making processes which are crucial for staying competitive in the marketplace.
